\chapter{Taking Part in iGEM Goes Green}\label{chap:takingpart}

Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen.

Example for the usage of the suggest-environment:

\begin{suggest}
	Safe pipette tips by pipetting from low to high concentration!
\end{suggest}

Here follows a further explanation on why one can safe pipette tips that way and maybe also some information on how big the impact is. Maybe there are several advantages we could itemize:
\begin{itemize}
	\item First advantage
	\item Second advantage
	\item Wow, so many advantages!
\end{itemize}


But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her. Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.
